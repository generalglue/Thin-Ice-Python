# Thin Ice! Pygame Edition!

This python project is a 90% faithful remake of Club Penguin's arcade mini game, Thin Ice! The basic gist of the game is for you to reach to the exit tile, gaining more score as you walk on more tiles. As you go further in, more mechanics are introduced to make each level harder.
 
## How to install/play

Installing this project to edit with the source code is pretty easy, all you have to do is clone/download the repo, and open it with your IDE with the prequisites installed.
Playing the game is pretty easy as well. You can either run the ThinIce.py by downloading the repo, or go to the release page and download the latest .exe zip!

### Prerequisites

Pygame 2 and at least Python 3.6 is needed to run the game.
