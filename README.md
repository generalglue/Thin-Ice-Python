# Thin Ice! Pygame Edition!

This python project is a 90% faithful remake of Club Penguin's arcade mini game, Thin Ice! The basic gist of the game is for you to reach to the exit tile, gaining more score as you walk on more tiles. As you go further in, more mechanics are introduced to make each level harder.
 
## Getting Started

Installing this project to tinker with yourself is pretty easy, all you have to do is clone/download the repo, and open it with your IDE.

### Prerequisites

Pygame 2 and at least Python 3.6 is needed to run the game.
